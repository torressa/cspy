# cspy

A collection of algorithms for the (resource) Constrained Shortest Path (CSP) problem.

The CSP problem was popularised by [Inrich and Desaulniers (2005)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227142556_Shortest_Path_Problems_with_Resource_Constraints). It was initially introduced as a subproblem for the bus driver scheduling problem, and has since then widely studied in a variety of different settings including: the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), the technician routing and scheduling problem, the capacitated arc-routing problem, on-demand transportation systems, and, airport ground movement; among others.

More generally, in the applied column generation framework, particularly in the scheduling related literature, the CSP problem is commonly employed to generate columns.

Therefore, this library is of interest to the operational research community, students and academics alike, that wish to solve an instance of the CSP problem.

## Algorithms

Currently, the exact and metaheuristic algorithms implemented include:

- [x] Monodirectional forward labeling algorithm (exact);
- [x] Monodirectional backward labeling algorithm (exact);
- [x] Bidirectional labeling algorithm with dynamic halfway point (exact) [Tilk et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221717302035);
- [x] Heuristic Tabu search (metaheuristic);
- [x] Greedy elimination procedure (metaheuristic);
- [x] Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) (metaheuristic). Adapted from [Ferone et al. (2019)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10556788.2018.1548015);
- [x] Particle Swarm Optimization with combined Local and Global Expanding Neighborhood Topology (PSOLGENT) (metaheuristic) [Marinakis et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221717302357).

Please see the individual algorithms API Documentation for some toy examples and more details:

- [Heuristic Tabu Search](https://cspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cspy.Tabu.html)
- [Greedy Elimination Procedure](https://cspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cspy.GreedyElim.html)
- [GRASP](https://cspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cspy.GRASP.html)
- [PSOLGENT](https://cspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cspy.PSOLGENT.html)
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Conceptual background and input formatting is discussed in the [docs](https://cspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to.html).

Module dependencies are:

- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/)
- [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/)

Note that [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains modules for development purposes.

### Installing

Installing the `cspy` package with `pip` should also install all the required packages. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal

```none
pip install cspy
```

or

```none
python3 -m pip install cspy
```

### Examples

- [`vrpy`](https://github.com/Kuifje02/vrpy) : External vehicle routing framework which uses `cspy` to solve different variants of the vehicle routing problem using column generation.
- [`cgar`](examples/cgar) : Complex example use of `cspy` in a column generation example applied to the aircraft recovery problem.
- [`jpath`](examples/jpath) : Simple example showing the necessary graph adptations and the use of custom resource extension functions.

The generic gist to run the algorithms on a specific graph is to load the
algorithm of choice, say `alg`, call the `alg.run()` method, and query the
relevant result attributes,

- `alg.path` for a list with the nodes in the path;
- `alg.total_cost` for the accumulated cost of the path;
- `alg.consumed_resources` for the accumulated resource usage of the path.

## Running the tests

To run the tests first, clone the repository into a path in your machine `~/path/newfolder` by running

```none
git clone https://github.com/torressa/cspy.git ~/path/newfolder
```

Then, go into the folder and run the tests using `unittest`

```none
cd ~/path/newfolder
python3 -m unittest
```

Please make sure that the python package cspy is not already installed in your machine.
