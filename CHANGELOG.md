## [unreleased]

## [v1.0.0]

### Changed

 - Graph implementation replaced with [LEMON](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon). This brings significant improvement.

### Added
 - Benchmarks against boost's r_c_shortest_paths (#65)

### Fixed
 - Issues #66, #68, #69, #72

## [v1.0.0-alpha]

### Changed

Rewrite of the bidirectional algorithm in C++ interfaced with Python using SWIG.

The algorithm improvements include:
 - Faster joining procedure (when `direction="both"`) with lower bounding and sorted labels
 - Bounds pruning using shortest path algorithm lower bounds and the primal bound obtained during the search (experimental).
 - Backwards incompatible change to do with custom REFs. Now, instead of specifying each function separately, you can implement them in class that inherits from `REFCallback`. and then pass them to the algorithm using the `REF_callback` parameter. This change applies to all algorithms.
 Note that:
   1. the naming of the functions has to match (`REF_fwd`, `REF_bwd` and `REF_join`)
   2. so does the number of arguments (not necessarily the naming of the variables though)
   3. not all three have to be implemented. If for example, one is just using `direction="forward"`, then only `REF_fwd` would suffice. In the case of the callback being passed and only part of the functions implemented, the default implementation will used for the missing ones.

e.g.
```python
from cspy import BiDirectional, REFCallback

class MyCallback(REFCallback):

    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        # You can use custom arguments and save for later use
        REFCallback.__init__(self) # Init parent
        self._arg1: int = arg1
        self._arg2: bool = arg2

    def REF_fwd(self, cumul_res, tail, head, edge_res, partial_path,
                cumul_cost):
        res_new = list(cumul_res) # local copy
        # do some operations on `res_new` maybe using `self._arg1/2`
        return res_new

    def REF_bwd(self, cumul_res, tail, head, edge_res, partial_path,
                cumul_cost):
        res_new = list(cumul_res) # local copy
        # do some operations on `res_new` maybe using `self._arg1/2`
        return res_new

    def REF_join(self, fwd_resources, bwd_resources, tail, head, edge_res):
        fwd_res = list(fwd_resources) # local copy
        # do some operations on `res_new` maybe using `self._arg1/2`
        return fwd_res

# Load G, max_res, min_res
alg = BiDirectional(G, max_res, min_res, REF_callback=MyCallback(1, True))
```

### Added
 - Benchmarks (and comp results for BiDirectional) from Beasley and Christofides (1989)

### Fixed

 - [BiDirectional] Bug fix for non-elementary paths (#52)
 - [PSOLGENT] Bug fix for local search (#57)

### Removed
 - BiDirectional python implementation (can be found [here](https://github.com/torressa/cspy/tree/fba830cac02c1914670ca2def90c5c3447fd61e1))
 - BiDirectional `method="random"` see issues (hopefully only temporary).

## [v0.1.2] - 31/07/2020

### Added

- New paramenters: `time_limit` and `threshold`.
- Custom REF, backward incompatible change: additional argument for more flexibility. These are the current partial path and the accumulated cost. Note that these are optional and do not have to be used. However, a slight modificiation to the function has to be made, simply add `**kwargs` as well as the existing arguments.

## [v0.1.1] - 21/05/2020

### Changed
- BiDirectional:
  - Reverted backward REF as it is required for some problems.
  - Added REF join parameter that is required when joining forward and backward labels using custom REFs.
- Moved notes and examples from docstrings to the docs folder.
- Final JOSS paper changes

## [v0.1.0] - 14/04/2020

### Added

- BiDirectional:
  - Option to chose method for direction selection.
- [vrpy](https://github.com/Kuifje02/vrpy) submodule.

### Changed

- BiDirectional:
  - Label storage, divided into unprocessed, generated and non-dominated labels
  - Restricted join algorithm to non-dominated label
  - Changed backward resource extensions to avoid complex and computationally costly inversion. Additionally, it removes the requirement of an explicit backward REF.
  - Filtering for backward labels in join algorithm.
  - Cleaned up unused label operator overloads.
  - Removed costly comparison in `_propagate_label`.
  - Changed generated labels attributes from dict of deques to dict of int with count.

- Rework of path and algorithm attributes to avoid duplication
- Replaced `networkx.astar` algorithm with a procedure that finds a short simple
path using `networkx.shortest_simple_paths`.

### Removed

- Negative edge cycle assumption

  - Rectified half-way check.
- parameterized some tests.

## [v0.0.12] - 14/03/2020

### Changed

- BiDirectional algorithm:
  - **Removed** termination criteria.
  - Implemented half way procedure from [Righini and Salani (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572528606000417) in `self._half_way` (Closes #21).
  - Changed label dominance to an equivalent but more elegant function.
  - Changed final label saving to account for when neither of two labels dominate.
- Backwards incompatible path, cost and total_resource feature.
- Preprocessing functions.

## [v0.0.11] - 06/03/2020

## Fixed

- BiDirectional algorithm: returning path with edge not in graph (Closes #17 :pray:).
- Heuristic used in Tabu for input in the networkx.astar_path algorithm (Closes #20).

### Changed

- Documentation.
- BiDirectional algorithm:

  - Final label comparisons.
  - Seed handling for testing.
  - Renamed variables to avoid confusion. - Avoiding getting stuck processing cycles of input graphs. - Ensuring that edges in path correspond to an edge in the input graph. - Avoid overwriting inputs (`max_res` and `min_res`). - Removed loops in `_get_next_label` and `_check_dominance` in favour of list comprehensions. - Use of `collections`. - logs for debugging in BiDirectional.
  - added `_save_current_best_label`.
  - Changed type of `self.finalLabel["direction"]` from list to `Label`.

- Re-organised. Moved `label.py` and `path.py` into `algorithms/`.
