## [Unreleased]

### Changed 

- BiDirectional
  - Label storage, divided into unprocessed, generated and non-dominated labels
  - Restricted join algorithm to non-dominated labels 
  - Changed backward resource extensions to avoid complex and computationally costly inversion. Additionally, it removes the requirement of an explicit backward REF.


## [v0.0.14]

### Removed

- Bidirectional
  - Removed use of halway point filtering for labels

## [v0.0.13]

### Added

- Included dev requirements file with new package for testing and examples requirements.

### Changed

- BiDirectional algorithm:
  - Resource based comparisons for label extension
  - Simplified attributes.
  - Implemented full path joining procedure from [Righini and Salani (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572528606000417).
  - Rectified half-way check.
- parameterized some tests.

## [v0.0.12] - 14/03/2020

### Changed

- Documentation.
- BiDirectional algorithm:
  - **Removed** termination criteria.
  - Implemented half way procedure from [Righini and Salani (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572528606000417) in `self._half_way` (Closes #21).
  - Changed label dominance to an equivalent but more elegant function.
  - Changed final label saving to account for when neither of two labels dominate.
- Backwards incompatible path, cost and total_resource feature.
- Preprocessing functions.

## [v0.0.11] - 06/03/2020

## Fixed

- BiDirectional algorithm: returning path with edge not in graph (Closes #17 :pray:).
- Heuristic used in Tabu for input in the networkx.astar_path algorithm (Closes #20).

### Changed

- Documentation.
- BiDirectional algorithm:

  - Final label comparisons.
  - Seed handling for testing.
  - Renamed variables to avoid confusion. - Avoiding getting stuck processing cycles of input graphs. - Ensuring that edges in path correspond to an edge in the input graph. - Avoid overwriting inputs (`max_res` and `min_res`). - Removed loops in `_get_next_label` and `_check_dominance` in favour of list comprehensions. - Use of `collections`. - logs for debugging in BiDirectional.
  - added `_save_current_best_label`.
  - Changed type of `self.finalLabel["direction"]` from list to `Label`.

- Re-organised. Moved `label.py` and `path.py` into `algorithms/`.

## [v0.0.10] - 09/02/2020

## Added

- PuLP example.

## Changed

- Documentation.
- Translated `examples/cgar` from gurobipy to pulp.
- CI build.

## [v0.0.9] - 25/12/2019

## Added

- Added example directory with column generation example.
- Check for negative cost cycles.

### Changed

- Improved documentation.
- unit tests structure.

## [v0.0.8] - 15/07/2019

### Added

- Personal MIT LICENSE.
- `GreedyElim` Procedure.

### Changed

- Documentation updates.
- Docstring modifications to include maths.
- Updated README.
